===================

### Perl scripts developed for use the Sierra ILS (Integrated Library System)

These are scripts, implemented in Perl, that are designed to work with the Sierra ILS.  Feel free to use them in your library at your discretion.  I have made every effort to delineate variables and sections of code that need to be customized to suit your library's specific implementation.  Feel free to fork this code as you feel necessary; pull requests are also welcome.
